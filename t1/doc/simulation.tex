\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
under analysis. Compared to the theoretical analysis results, one notices no differences.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
    \hline    
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
    \input{../sim/op_tab}
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Operating point. A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
    and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
    Volt.}
  \label{tab:op}
\end{table}

There is an additional node 6b, between nodes 6 and 7, because the system needs a voltage source to know the current that is going through the resistor $R_6$ to insert the current-controlled voltage source $V_c$ in the circuit.
