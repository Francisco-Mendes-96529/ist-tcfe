\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analyzing the RC circuit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:t2} has been achieved. Time and frequency analyses have been performed both theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. The simulation results matched the theoretical results, apart from some voltages calculated in Step 2. Nonetheless, even this difference can be attributed to the precision of the data used that renders voltages as low as the ones obtained null. Having that into consideration, the simulation and theoretical results matched in every step, observed by comparing each step's tables and/or plots.
