\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of making a Bandpass filter using OP-AMP shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:t5-real} has been achieved.
The values for the components in Table~\ref{tab:values} has a merit of approximately $3,88 \times 10^{-6}$
and a cost of 13626,95 MU, with a gain of 39,98 dB and a central frequency of 981,37 $Hz$.
