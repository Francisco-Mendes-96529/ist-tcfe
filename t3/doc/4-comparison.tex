\section{Comparison}
\label{sec:comparison}

Comparing the results achieved in the simulation, Table~\ref{tab:t3}, and in the theoretical
analysis, Table~\ref{tab:vout}, it is possible to see a small difference.

This discrepancy may have resulted from the assumption made in Step~\ref{subsec:step1},
since $Ripple\ (\%)$ theoretical $\approx rippleperc$ simulated, and
$Deviation\ (\%)$ theoretical $\not\approx rippleperc$ simulated. 
However this assumption is needed, since without it, the analysis would become very difficult.

Additionally, there would be always some very small differences due to the non-linearity of the equations.
