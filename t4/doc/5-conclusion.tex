\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of making an Audio Amplifier shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:t4-transistors} has been achieved.
The values for the components in Table~\ref{tab:values} has a merit of approximately 3775
and a cost of 15606,41 MU, with a gain of 67,57, a lower cut-off frequency of 4,37 $Hz$ and a upper cut-off
frequency of 3,81 $MHz$.
