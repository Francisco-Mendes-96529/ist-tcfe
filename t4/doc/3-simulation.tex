\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}

\subsection{Process}

For an AC/DC converter is needed an envelope detector and a voltage regulator in parallel.

The envelope detector is usually a full-wave bridge rectifier in parallel
with a capacitor and a resistor.

The voltage regulator is a resistor in series with a set of diodes.

After analyzing these two sub-circuits, we concluded that a resistor in parallel
with the capacitor was not needed, since we had a resistor in the voltage
regulator, and that was the only resistor necessary.

Sequentially, we tested different values in order to obtain the best merit possible.


\subsection{Results}

The plots obtained are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dc-23-45}. The ripple and average at the output
of the envelope detector, ve, and voltage regulator, vo, and merit are presented in Table~\ref{tab:t3}.\\
