\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing a circuit with independent and
dependent sources has been
achieved. The simulation results matched the theoretical results
precisely with both analysis methods. The reason for this perfect match is the fact that this is a
straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical
and simulation models should not differ. For more complex components, the
theoretical and simulation models could differ but this is not the case in this
work.
